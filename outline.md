Sequentially, the player's game experience should be entertaining but also show useful concepts about the software lifecycle and teach
terms in a way that beginners can also learn.

The game will start with some text form of menu which the player can start a game, adjust some settings (maybe difficulty?), and also quit
the program. Starting the game will launch the player into the dungeon world that is software development.

Players progress through dungeons which are rooms connected by hallways, encountering occasional "programming problems" as monsters guarding dungeon areas. The end goal is to traverse the dungeon to reach a "popular product" as the final boss and clear the dungeon. The player represents a green programmer, learning to solve "problems" by fighting them in a style reminecent of pokemon. Along the way, the player can learn new skills and find items to aid them along their quest.

The dungeons consist of the days of the week, slowly passing in time as the player progresses and learns programming tools and fights problems. The monsters of the dungeon are problems often seen in programming and can inflict various attacks against the player.

The player is a adventurous programmer, entering the dungeon to sharpen their skills and become a pro by defeating the dungeon boss. As they progress, new skills and new items are unlocked and the difficulty increases too. Skills consist of good programming practices as well as various tools in different languages that give the player an edge agaisnt the problem monsters residing in dungeons. Items are consumables which give temporary boosts to the player for the next dungeon.
